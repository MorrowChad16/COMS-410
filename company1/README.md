KickStarter open sourced their android app. There aren't many examples of android TDD projects out there, and this one is one of the best.
The code doesn't make a lot of sense at first, but since they follow TDD, looking at the test classes first makes it much easier to follow.
They also use the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern: https://github.com/kickstarter/android-oss

This contains the php files on the server(coms-510-01.cs.iastate.edu) at /var/www/html

You can ssh to the server: ssh netid@coms-510-01.cs.iastate.edu

Check the connection.php file for the correct server address. It should have your serveraddress coms-510-01.cs.iastate.edu

There are no documents/schemas of the tables. However, through mysql workbench you can get information about tables and schemas.

Note: Gitlab does not automatically deploy the files to the server, one will have to transfer files to the server manually.
